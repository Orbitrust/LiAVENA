# Project Proposal

**Website Title:** Famous Filipino Food <br /> <br />

**Comprehensive Description:**  In this website, different Filipino food such as chicken adobo and pork giniling will be described, as well as the rich background and history of said dishes. The recipes and various ingredients used to make these will also be included. Viewing this website will allow the user to gain new knowledge and appreciation for these dishes.  <br /> <br />

**Outline:** For this website, five web pages will be created, with one of them serving as the home page. A logo will be placed in the upper right corner of each page, which will direct the user to the home page. A breadcrumb will also be located next to the logo with links for the other pages. Located in the home page is a description of the website as well as four images of Filipino dishes as links that will direct the user to the four pages. Chicken adobo will be talked about in the first page, including the ingredients to be used, the recipe in making it, and its history. Images of said dish and ingredients will be added for more understanding. For the second page, everything is similar to the first except the dish is now pork giniling. This is also the case with the third page, where the dish is pork sinigang. Finally, the fourth page contains information about pork steak. <br /> <br />
